It is frustrating to hide the facts,\" said a senior interior ministry official in Kabul.A senior NDS official in Kabul said at least 50 people were killed or wounded in the complex attack.Abdurrahman Mangal, spokesman for the provincial governor in Maidan Wardak said 12 people were killed and 12 were injured when the car bomb exploded near the Afghan special forces unit.President Ashraf Ghani's office in a statement said the \"enemies of the country\" had carried out an attack against NDS personnel in Maidan Shahr. \"They killed and wounded a number of our beloved and honest sons.\"Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan condemned the attack on Monday evening and extended his condolences to Ghani.Meanwhile, the Taliban said it met with U.S. officials in Qatar on Monday, in the latest round of talks between the insurgents and Washington aimed at bringing an end to the 17-year war.The U.S. has not officially commented on the reported meeting, which follows the last confirmed talks between the two parties in the UAE in December.\"Following American acceptance of the agenda of ending the occupation of Afghanistan and preventing Afghanistan from being used against other countries in the future, talks with American representatives took place today in Doha, the capital of Qatar,\" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement.Taliban representatives have met several times with U.S. officials in recent months, but last week threatened to suspend the fledgling process, lambasting Washington for changing the agenda of the talks and \"unilaterally\" adding new subjects.The insurgents have long refused to hold direct talks with the Kabul government -- despite U.S. pleas -- which the Taliban dismisses as a puppet of Washington.In recent years the Afghan government has stopped releasing detailed casualty figures.

{"prompt": "The Taliban killed more than 100 members of the Afghan security forces inside a military compound in central Maidan Wardak province on Monday, a senior defense official said.\"We have information that 126 people have been killed in the explosion inside the military training center, eight special commandoes are among the dead,\" said a senior official in the defense ministry in Kabul, speaking on condition of anonymity.The official said the assault began on Monday morning when the attackers rammed a car full explosives through a military checkpoint and detonated the vehicle inside the campus of the National Directorate of Security (NDS) forces training center in Maidan Shahr, the capital of Maidan Wardak province.Two gunmen entered the campus right after the explosion and shot at many Afghan soldiers before being gunned down during the clashes.Defense ministry officials said the Taliban had used U.S.-made armored Humvee vehicles captured from Afghan forces as a car bomb in order to breach the military fortifications.A second source residing in Maidan Wardak province said more than 100 members of National Directorate of Security (NDS) were killed in the complex attack.\"I have been in touch with the NDS official in the province and they told me that over 100 members of the NDS were killed in the big explosion,\" the former provincial official said.Sharif Hotak, a member of the provincial council in Maidan Wardak said he saw bodies of 35 Afghan forces in the hospital.\"Many more were killed. Several bodies were transported to Kabul city and many injured were transferred to hospitals in Kabul,\" said Hotak, adding that \"the government was hiding the accurate casualty figures to prevent a further dip in the morale of the Afghan forces.\"\"The explosion was very powerful. The whole building has collapsed,\" he said.Government officials in Maidan Wardak and Kabul declined to comment when asked if they were obscuring the death toll.Two senior officials in the interior ministry said the exact casualty figures were not being disclosed to prevent unrest within the armed forces.\"I have been told not to make the death toll figures public. It is frustrating to hide the facts,\" said a senior interior ministry official in Kabul.A senior NDS official in Kabul said at least 50 people were killed or wounded in the complex attack.Abdurrahman Mangal, spokesman for the provincial governor in Maidan Wardak said 12 people were killed and 12 were injured when the car bomb exploded near the Afghan special forces unit.President Ashraf Ghani's office in a statement said the \"enemies of the country\" had carried out an attack against NDS personnel in Maidan Shahr. \"They killed and wounded a number of our beloved and honest sons.\"Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan condemned the attack on Monday evening and extended his condolences to Ghani.Meanwhile, the Taliban said it met with U.S. officials in Qatar on Monday, in the latest round of talks between the insurgents and Washington aimed at bringing an end to the 17-year war.The U.S. has not officially commented on the reported meeting, which follows the last confirmed talks between the two parties in the UAE in December.\"Following American acceptance of the agenda of ending the occupation of Afghanistan and preventing Afghanistan from being used against other countries in the future, talks with American representatives took place today in Doha, the capital of Qatar,\" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement.Taliban representatives have met several times with U.S. officials in recent months, but last week threatened to suspend the fledgling process, lambasting Washington for changing the agenda of the talks and \"unilaterally\" adding new subjects.The insurgents have long refused to hold direct talks with the Kabul government -- despite U.S. pleas -- which the Taliban dismisses as a puppet of Washington.In recent years the Afghan government has stopped releasing detailed casualty figures. Last year Ghani has said 28,000 Afghan police officers and soldiers have been killed since 2015, breaking the longstanding suppression on casualty data.Taliban insurgents claimed responsibility for the attack. Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the hardline terrorist group said they have killed 190 people in the complex attack.Last week, Taliban fighters set off a car bomb outside a highly fortified compound killing at least five people and wounding more than 110 Afghans and expatriates in the capital, Kabul.On Sunday, a suicide bombing in the southeastern province of Logar left eight policemen dead and another 10 wounded.The Taliban bombing targeted the provincial governor's convoy in Mohammad Agha district. The provincial governor and spy chief traveling in the convoy were unharmed.The Taliban have ramped up their attacks on security forces and government facilities in recent months, while Afghan and U.S. troops have increased operations against the militants' field commanders.Military sources say around 35 members of the country's security forces are killed every day in attacks and clashes.This is while the U.S. is still considering a significant troop drawdown in Afghanistan.

Two off-duty soldiers lost their legs as a result of the bombing.==Background==In February 1975 the Provisional Irish Republican Army agreed to a truce and ceasefire with the British government and the Northern Ireland Office. Seven \"incident centres\" were established in Irish nationalist areas in Northern Ireland to monitor the ceasefire and the activity of the security forces. Before the truce, the IRA active service unit (ASU) later dubbed the Balcombe Street Gang (due to the December 1975 Balcombe Street siege) had been carrying out bomb and gun attacks in Southern England since autumn 1974, mostly in and around London. Their last previous attack was an assassination attempt on former Prime Minister Edward Heath but he was not home when the attackers threw a bomb into his bedroom window on 22 December 1974.==The bombing==The Balcombe Street Gang planted a time bomb in the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham, Surrey. The IRA unit placed the 7lb bomb in a duffel bag under a seat. There was no warning and the bomb exploded at 9:20, injuring 23 civilians and 10 off-duty soldiers. The pub was used by members of the Welsh Guards who were based at the barracks nearby. Some of the injuries were very serious, with at least three soldiers losing limbs.

The cell's campaign would continue until December 1975 when they were caught at the siege of Balcombe Street.

British farmers denied on Thursday there was any danger to human health from their sheep , but expressed concern that German government advice to consumers to avoid British lamb might influence consumers across Europe . \" What we have to be extremely careful of is how other countries are going to take Germany 's lead , \" Welsh National Farmers ' Union ( NFU ) chairman John Lloyd Jones said on BBC radio . Bonn has led efforts to protect public health after consumer confidence collapsed in March after a British report suggested humans could contract an illness similar to mad cow disease by eating contaminated beef . Germany imported 47,600 sheep from Britain last year , nearly half of total imports . It brought in 4,275 tonnes of British mutton , some 10 percent of overall imports .\n\nAccording to the above document, extract one named entity that (1) is a location; (2) is not a continent; (3) the official language here is not English; (4) is not a country; (5) is a city in Germany.
