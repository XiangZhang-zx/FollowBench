This process is a fundamental aspect of nuclear physics and is responsible for the stability of certain isotopes.\n\nThe reason neutrons decay is not directly related to their mass being more than the mass required for their lowest energy state. In fact, the mass of a neutron is actually very close to the sum of the masses of a proton and an electron. However, the neutron is unstable because of the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force.\n\nThe strong nuclear force holds the protons and neutrons together in the nucleus, while the weak nuclear force is responsible for the decay of the neutron. The weak nuclear force is a fundamental force of nature that allows for the transformation of one type of particle into another.\n\nThe reason neutrons decay is due to the following:\n\n1.  **Energy considerations**: The neutron has an excess of energy compared to the proton and electron that it decays into.

Protons and neutrons live in the nucleus, which is the center of the atom. Electrons orbit around the nucleus.\n\n**What is the mass defect?**\n\nWhen a neutron is formed, it's made up of three quarks: two \"up\" quarks and one \"down\" quark. These quarks are the building blocks of protons and neutrons. The mass of these quarks is slightly less than the mass of the neutron itself. This difference in mass is called the mass defect.\n\n**Why doesn't the neutron decay?**\n\nNow, you might think that the neutron would decay into a proton and an electron, releasing energy in the process, since it has excess mass.

The ball is in its most stable position, with the least amount of energy.
