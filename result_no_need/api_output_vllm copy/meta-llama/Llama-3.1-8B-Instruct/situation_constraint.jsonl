{"prompt": "You are asked to implement a C++ class to represent matrices. Here are the details of the required functionalities:\n\nDefine a class called Matrix that represents a 2D matrix of integers.\nThe class should have private member variables for the number of rows, the number of columns, and a 2D vector to store the matrix data.\nThe class should have a constructor that takes the number of rows and columns as arguments and initializes the matrix with zeros.\nImplement the operator() method that allows access to individual elements of the matrix using the row and column indices. Make sure to perform bounds checking and throw an std::out_of_range exception if the indices are out of bounds.\nImplement the operator+ method to perform matrix addition. The method should take another Matrix as an argument and return a new Matrix with the sum of the two matrices. If the dimensions of the matrices do not match, throw an std::invalid_argument exception.\nImplement a print method that prints the matrix to the standard output, displaying the elements row by row.", "choices": [{"message": {"content": "```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <stdexcept>\n\nclass Matrix {\nprivate:\n    int rows;\n    int cols;\n    std::vector<std::vector<int>> data;\n\npublic:\n    // Constructor to initialize the matrix with zeros\n    Matrix(int rows, int cols) : rows(rows), cols(cols), data(rows, std::vector<int>(cols, 0)) {}\n\n    // Operator() to access individual elements of the matrix\n    int operator()(int row, int col) const {\n        if (row < 0 || row >= rows || col < 0 || col >= cols) {\n            throw std::out_of_range(\"Indices out of bounds\");\n        }\n        return data[row][col];\n    }\n\n    // Operator() to modify individual elements of the matrix\n    int& operator()(int row, int col) {\n        if (row < 0 || row >= rows || col < 0 || col >= cols) {\n            throw std::out_of_range(\"Indices out of bounds\");\n        }\n        return data[row][col];\n    }\n\n    // Operator+ to perform matrix addition\n    Matrix operator+(const Matrix& other) const {\n        if (rows != other.rows || cols != other.cols) {\n            throw"}}]}
