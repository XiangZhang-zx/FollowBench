The system uses Python classes to define the different types of accounts and transactions.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Python 3.x\n- Pip\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Clone the repository to your local machine.\n2. Navigate to the project directory.\n3. Install the required dependencies using pip:\n\n```\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n1. To run the banking system, execute the following command:\n\n```\npython main.py\n```\n\n2. The program will prompt you to create an account. Enter the account type and account number.\n3. You can then perform transactions by entering the amount to deposit or withdraw.\n4. The program will display the account balance after each transaction.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome!
