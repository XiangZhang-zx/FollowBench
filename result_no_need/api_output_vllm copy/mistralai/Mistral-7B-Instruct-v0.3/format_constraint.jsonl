Set Goals: Clearly define what you want to achieve in a day, week, or month. This will give you a clear direction and help you stay focused.\n\n3. Use a Planner or Digital Calendar: Write down all your tasks, deadlines, and appointments. This will help you keep track of your schedule and ensure you don't miss anything.\n\n4. Time Blocking: Allocate specific time slots for different tasks or activities. This can help you stay focused and productive.\n\n5.
