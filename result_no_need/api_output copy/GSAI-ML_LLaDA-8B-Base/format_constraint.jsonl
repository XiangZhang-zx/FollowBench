For each tier, constrain your exposition to a paragraph, with a word limit of 200 words. Also, each sentence should be confined to a maximum of twenty words. Incorporate a format constraint where every sentence must commence with a transitional word or phrase. For example, “Firstly,” “In addition,” “Consequently,” to maintain the flow and coherence of the explanation."}
