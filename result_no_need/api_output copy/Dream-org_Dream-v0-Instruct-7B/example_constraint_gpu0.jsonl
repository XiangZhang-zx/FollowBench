Restoring Snake River salmon to healthy, \n        self-sustaining, harvestable levels will have significant \n        economic benefits for these communities. Understanding these \n        benefits is imperative to setting public policy on salmon \n        restoration efforts in the Northwest.\n            (8) The original range of Snake River salmon included not \n        only their existing habitat in...\n\nGiven the title: \"Power Marketing Administration Reform Act of 1998\" and the summary of a bill: Power Marketing Administration Reform Act of 1998 - Requires the Secretary of Energy to develop and implement procedures to ensure that the Federal Power Marketing Administrations (FPMAs) utilize the same accounting principles and requirements as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) applies to the electric operations of public utilities. \n(Sec. 4) Requires each FPMA and the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to submit periodically for FERC review rates for the sale or disposition of Federal energy that will ensure recovery of all their costs in generating and marketing such energy. \nPrescribes rate mechanism and pricing guidelines. \nEstablishes a fund within the Department of the Interior to:  (1) mitigate damage to environmental resources attributable to power generation and sales facilities; and (2) restore the health of such resources, including fish and wildlife.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Power Marketing Administration \nReform Act of 1998''.\n\nSEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that:\n            (1) The use of fixed allocations of joint multipurpose \n        project costs and the failure to provide for the recovery of \n        actual interest costs and depreciation have resulted in \n        substantial failures to recover costs properly recoverable \n        through power rates by the Federal Power Marketing \n        Administrations and the Tennessee Valley Authority and have \n        resulted in the imposition of unreasonable burdens on the \n        taxpaying public.\n            (2) Existing under allocations and under recovery of costs \n        have led to inefficiencies in the marketing of Federally \n        generated electric power and to environmental damage.\n            (3) With the emergence of open access to power transmission \n        and competitive bulk power markets, market prices will provide \n        the lowest reasonable rates consistent with sound business \n        principles, consistent with maximum recovery of costs properly \n        allocated to power production and consistent with encouraging \n        the most widespread use of power marketed by Federal Power \n        Marketing Administrations and the Tennessee Valley Authority.\n\nSEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to provide for full cost recovery rates \nfor power sold by Federal Power Marketing Administrations and the \nTennessee Valley Authority and a transition to market-based rates for \nsuch power.\n\nSEC. 4. MODIFICATION OF EXISTING POWER MARKETING ADMINISTRATIONS.\n\n    (a) Accounting.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \nSecretary of Energy shall, in consultation with the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission, immediately upon enactment of this Act develop \nand implement procedures to ensure that the Federal Power Marketing \nAdministrations utilize the same accounting principles and \nrequirements, including those...'}\n\nGiven a title: \"To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to promote environmental protection and generate preservation efforts, and for other purposes.\" of a bill.\nWrite this bill based on this title.\nThe answer is: SECTION 1.

I'm selling this to buy booty shorts. I need at least 390 for those. \n\nwow, booty shorts have really gotten pricey! How about $368 and I throw in a pair of barely used blue sequin booty shorts to help you get started?\n\nInflation is a monster. And big booty women are always the first to feel the squeeze.

Are you looking for anything specific?\n\nI would like a 2 bedroom with a refrigerator and diishwasher for under $1,000\n\nSounds great. I have a 2 bedroom and  a 1 1/2 bath. It comes with a refrigerator, dishwasher and garbage disposal. I have it up for $1800.\n\nOh, that sounds pretty good but that is a bit high for me.  Do you have anything less expensive?\n\nWell the price is slightly higher because it is in a great location where everything is nearby such as shopping centers and schools. I can go slightly lower than $1800. How is $1500?\n\nWell it does seem convenient to be close to shopping.  Do I have to maintain my own yard or is that included? \n\nThat is included. Water and garbage are also paid by me to make it more convenient for you. \n\nWell I might be able to pay $1,300 a month if I could have a small pet.  My kids has been wanting a pet forever.\n\nSorry, we don't allow animals.

Amazing bargain right?\n\nseems like a deal, why are you selling?\n\nWell to be honest I just met an NBA player and he insists that I close my interior design business and learn to cheerlead. \n\nwow, thats amazing. Sounds like you'll be making big money, so you can probably afford to let this scanner go for like $350? ;)\n\nah ha! You're sharp. But actually cheerleaders make less than minimum wage. I'm selling this to buy booty shorts. I need at least 390 for those. \n\nwow, booty shorts have really gotten pricey! How about $368 and I throw in a pair of barely used blue sequin booty shorts to help you get started?\n\nInflation is a monster. And big booty women are always the first to feel the squeeze. Let's go with 375, gently used blue booty shorts and you teach me a couple dance moves?
