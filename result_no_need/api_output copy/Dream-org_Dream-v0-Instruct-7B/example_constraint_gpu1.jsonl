{"prompt_new": "Generate a question from the following passage that has the answer, video of the Ridsdel execution\nPassage : On 21 September, 2015, Canadians Robert Hall and John Ridsdel, as well as Norwegian Kjartan Sekkingstad, and  Marites Flor; a Filipino woman, were abducted on Samai island near Davao. Ridsdel was beheaded by Abu Sayyaf on 25 April 2016 following a ransom deadline. ASG reportedly demanded more than $8.1 million for Ridsdel and the others. On 3 May, 2016, a video of the Ridsdel execution was released, along with new demands for the remaining hostages. A masked captor said, \"Note to the Philippine government and to the Canadian government: The lesson is clear. John Ridsdel has been beheaded. Now there are three remaining captives here. If you procrastinate once again the negotiations, we will behead this all anytime\". On 15 May, Hall  appeared in a new video, announcing that he and Norwegian Kjartan Sekkingstad would be decapitated at 3pm on Monday 13 June absent a ransom of $16 million. Both hostages wore orange coveralls, similar to hostages in videos produced by ISIL, to which Abu Sayyaf had previously pledged allegiance. The deadline passed. Hall was beheaded. On 24 June, Abu Sayyaf released Filipina Marites Flor. She was subsequently flown to Davao to meet President-elect Rodrigo Duterte. Duterte said he directed negotiations with the Abu Sayyaf. He did not elaborate. On 17 September, 2016, remaining hostage Norwegian Kjartan Sekkingstad was released on Jolo island. Abu Ramie, an ASG spokesman, claimed $638,000 was paid as ransom.\nQuestion :\n[Answer]\nWhat happened first, a video of the Risdel execution being released or the release of Kjartan Sekkingstad?\n\nPassage:  Trying to halt a two-game losing streak, the Ravens traveled to MetLife for one of their two straight games there. The Ravens had a chance to win the game by driving down the field in the final seconds, but the Giants defense held the Ravens back as Flacco threw an incompletion on the final play, dropping the Ravens to 3-3 and their second three-game losing streak in a year. The Ravens defense allowed Beckham two 60+ yard touchdowns, helping the Giants win.\nQuestion: How many losing streaks of 3+ games did the Ravens experience on the year?\nAnswer:\n{'response': '2'}\n\nI am trying to figure out the answer to the question, \"How many prisoners all together were released after the  surrender of Japan?\" I found the following text-snippet has the answer. Can you tell me the answer?\n\nJapanese prisoner-of-war camps, many of which were used as labour camps, also had high death rates. The International Military Tribunal for the Far East found the death rate of Western prisoners was 27.1 per cent , seven times that of POWs under the Germans and Italians. While 37,583 prisoners from the UK, 28,500 from the Netherlands, and 14,473 from the United States were released after the surrender of Japan, the number of Chinese released was only 56. At least five million Chinese civilians from northern China and Manchukuo were enslaved between 1935 and 1941 by the East Asia Development Board, or K\u014dain, for work in mines and war industries. After 1942, the number reached 10 million. In Java, between 4 and 10 million r\u014dmusha , were forced to work by the Japanese military. About 270,000 of these Javanese labourers were sent to other Japanese-held areas in South East Asia, and only 52,000 were repatriated to Java.\nThe response of the bot is: 80556\n\nContext:  The Patriots were hoping to stave off a losing streak and rebound from their loss to the Cardinals in this rematch of the AFC Championship. After both teams initial possession ended in punts, the Patriots drove to the Ravens 19 before settling for a Gostkowski field goal. On the first play of the Ravens' next drive, Steve Gregory intercepted Joe Flacco at the 42 and returned it 36 yards to the Ravens 6-yard line. Three plays later Brandon Bolden ran in a 2-yard touchdown, extending the lead to 10-0. Following another Ravens punt, the Patriots may have missed a chance to put the game away. After driving to the Ravens 27, an offensive pass interference penalty on Rob Gronkowski moved the ball to the Ravens 30. Then, a 19-yard reception on 2-and-11 was nullified by an offensive pass interference penalty moved the ball back to the Ravens 40, eventually ending in a 49-yard Gostkowski field goal, keeping the Ravens in the game. This time the Ravens finally managed a response driving 80 yards to score to score on a 25-yard touchdown pass from Flacco to Torrey Smith, trimming the score to 13-7. On the drive, Jerod Mayo was called for pass interference on 3rd-and-6 and Flacco completed a 14-yard pass on 3rd-and-13. Following a Patriots punt, the Ravens marched 92 yards in over 6 minutes to take a 14-13 lead on a 20-yard touchdown reception by Dennis Pitta. The Patriots took the lead right back marching 81 yards and never faced a third-down, taking the lead on a 7-yard touchdown reception by Edelman for a 20-14 halftime lead. In the second half the Ravens took the opening drive 80 yards and scored on a 7-yard touchdown run by Ray Rice to allow Baltimore to retake a 21-20 lead. Again the Patriots took the lead right back on a 12 play, 78-yard march to take a 27-21 lead on a 3-yard touchdown run by Danny Woodhead. Following a Ravens punt the Patriots drove all the way to the Ravens 2-yard line, but had to settle for a 20-yard field goal, making the score 30-21 early in the fourth quarter. The Ravens proceeded to drive...\nI am trying to figure out the answer to the question from the above context.  Can you tell me the answer?\nQuestion: How many points did the Ravens win by?\nAnswer:\nAI assistant: 1\n\nQuestion: Who did Vlad \u0162epe\u015f want mobilized?\nAnswer based on following passage.\n\nVlad \u0162epe\u015f asked the Hungarian king for assistance.  He received no support despite promises made by Corvinus and instead called for a mobilization that included \"not only men of military age, but also of women and of children from the age of twelve up; and included Gypsy slave contingents.\" Various sources mention the strength of his army to be between 22,000 and 30,900, with the most popular accepted number set at 30,000.

Additional costs of maintaining the device and battery replacement drive the costs higher. In reality however the overall economic impact of the devices is just about the same as treatment of high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol when life years (a commonly applied economic marker) is considered. As with the harms, the benefits are not quantified. The story says up high that patients who fell outside the guidelines had a \u201chigher risk of dying in the hospital and of complications from the implantation.\u201d But there are no numbers provided. In fact, there are more percentages provided in this story about the stock prices of the various device makers involved than there are about the harms or benefits. This is the Wall Street Journal, of course, but we still thought some additional numbers about harms or benefits would have been helpful to any reader. The story attempts to evaluate the quality of the evidence, but it falls short. In comparing the way this story brings context to the shocking findings to the way the LA Times does, this story is confusing and potentially misleading. We have read these paragraphs several times and still are not sure what they mean: Did these patients attempt to sign up for clinical trials and were denied? And what is the bill that the 22.5% will not fit? The LA Times story examines the study in much clearer language and provides the right context. The story does not engage in disease-mongering.

The story states that 80 to 95% of women have no bleeding after taking the drug. However, that leaves a lot of open questions about the effectiveness of the drug. For example, how long does this benefit last? What about other symptoms of fibroids like abdominal pain and pressure? The story repeatedly mentions that the drug shrinks fibroids. By how much? Is that difference clinically meaningful? In other words, can women perceive an improvement in bulk symptoms\u00a0(pain, pressure) as a result of the decreased fibroid size? Do the fibroids grow back? The story mentions the potential harm of elevated liver function test results. However, it does not explain\u00a0 that women commonly experience abdominal pain, headaches and nausea with this drug. The story does not critically appraise the current study. This was a small study (57 patients) with a short follow-up time. The results have also yet to be fully evaluated and have only been presented at a scientific conference. The story verges on disease mongering by exaggerating the seriousness of fibroids. While it is true that up to 80% of women may have fibroids, only about 20% of women will have symptoms that are bothersome enough that they would seek treatment. Fibroids in of themselves are benign and are not problematic unless they cause symptoms and treatment should only be initiated if a woman is bothered by them. Symptoms of fibroids also most often go away after menopause. However, this story leaves the impression that all women with fibroids should be treated. The story quoted multiple independent experts. The story mentions Lupron and Uterine Artery Embolization as alternatives to EllaOne but fails to mention many other safe and effective options that are currently available.

The costs for regularly prescribed drugs for the medical condition that\u2019s the focus of the study \u2014 weakened left ventricular function \u2014 are well known and although cimaglermin is an experimental drug, it should be possible to predict whether the new drug would be comparatively priced, cheaper or more expensive. Readers would benefit from that knowledge. While this story discusses that the drug seemed to benefit patients and was effective, it doesn\u2019t say how that was measured, and by how much the measurement improved due to the drug. (By digging into the research paper, via figure 3, we found that the benefits were measured by tracking absolute increases in\u00a0ejection fraction, which is the amount of blood pumped out the ventricles. It increased 8% in the group receiving a medium or high dose of the medicine.) One issue that might be confusing for readers: The story notes that a \u201cphase 1 trial like this one is designed to see if a new drug is safe, not to test its effectiveness.\u201d If that\u2019s the case, then why is the framing of the story about how effective it was? The story clearly points out that side effects included nausea and headaches, and that one participant did experience abnormal liver function after receiving the highest dose, a side effect that eventually cleared up. This is a strong point of the story: It clearly establishes that this was a small phase one randomized controlled trial, and the story explains what that means for the drug\u2019s development. A phase 1 trial like this one is designed to see if a new drug is safe, not to test its effectiveness. Before cimaglermin could be used to treat patients, it must prove its worth in a series of progressively larger and challenging trials and then be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The process can take several years. Based on these preliminary findings, larger trials are being planned, Lenihan said.

It would have been helpful to readers to discuss the approximate cost of a massage session, which can vary widely depending on the region, therapist and setting. The Center for Spirituality & Healing at the University of Minnesota estimates the national average for an hour-long massage to be about $60. Many people may wonder if their insurance policy would cover a massage therapy session. Insurance companies rarely pay for massage therapy, particularly for indications that aren\u2019t backed by science or evidence. The news release cited three studies, but descriptions of the research were too vague to be helpful. Readers aren\u2019t given any benefit data or any quantitative estimate on how well massage therapy actually works. We don\u2019t know how many participants were in each trial and who actually benefited from massage therapy. The release alludes to the fact several times that the immune system became stronger, but how was this measured? There are also non-specific references to the benefits of massage therapy, such as increasing the activity of white blood cells and reducing anxiety levels, but again, we don\u2019t know who actually benefited and by how much. When we looked at the studies cited we were surprised to find that none of them related to massage therapy for reducing rates of the \u201ccommon cold, flu and other seasonal illnesses,\u201d as claimed in the release. The first study was from 2010 and is described by its authors as \u201cpreliminary\u201d work that looks at a \u201csingle-session comparison of Swedish Massage Therapy with a light touch control condition\u201d measuring \u00a0\u201cOxytocin (OT), arginine-vasopressin (AVP), adrenal corticotropin hormone (ACTH), cortisol (CORT), circulating phenotypic lymphocytes markers, and mitogen-stimulated cytokine production.\u201d\u00a0 This study is far removed from patient-oriented, or even disease-oriented outcomes, and has nothing to do with their sweeping comments that massage may fend off flu and the common cold.

Additional costs of maintaining the device and battery replacement drive the costs higher. In reality however the overall economic impact of the devices is just about the same as treatment of high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol when life years (a commonly applied economic marker) is considered. As with the harms, the benefits are not quantified. The story says up high that patients who fell outside the guidelines had a \u201chigher risk of dying in the hospital and of complications from the implantation.\u201d But there are no numbers provided. In fact, there are more percentages provided in this story about the stock prices of the various device makers involved than there are about the harms or benefits.

The story attempts to evaluate the quality of the evidence, but it falls short. In comparing the way this story brings context to the shocking findings to the way the LA Times does, this story is confusing and potentially misleading. We have read these paragraphs several times and still are not sure what they mean: Did these patients attempt to sign up for clinical trials and were denied?

We spent some time on the fence...\nThe response of the bot is: likely false\n\nAfter reading:\n\n The story does not describe costs of the drug. The story states that 80 to 95% of women have no bleeding after taking the drug. However, that leaves a lot of open questions about the effectiveness of the drug. For example, how long does this benefit last? What about other symptoms of fibroids like abdominal pain and pressure? The story repeatedly mentions that the drug shrinks fibroids. By how much? Is that difference clinically meaningful? In other words, can women perceive an improvement in bulk symptoms\u00a0(pain, pressure) as a result of the decreased fibroid size? Do the fibroids grow back? The story mentions the potential harm of elevated liver function test results. However, it does not explain\u00a0 that women commonly experience abdominal pain, headaches and nausea with this drug. The story does not critically appraise the current study. This was a small study (57 patients) with a short follow-up time. The results have also yet to be fully evaluated and have only been presented at a scientific conference. The story verges on disease mongering by exaggerating the seriousness of fibroids. While it is true that up to 80% of women may have fibroids, only about 20% of women will have symptoms that are bothersome enough that they would seek treatment. Fibroids in of themselves are benign and are not problematic unless they cause symptoms and treatment should only be initiated if a woman is bothered by them. Symptoms of fibroids also most often go away after menopause. However, this story leaves the impression that all women with fibroids should be treated. The story quoted multiple independent experts. The story mentions Lupron and Uterine Artery Embolization as alternatives to EllaOne but fails to mention many other safe and effective options that are currently available. For example, oral contraceptives (which are not approved for fibroids but are commonly used for that indication) can help reduce bleeding and cramping associated with fibroids. Likewise, the Mirena IUD often stops bleeding altogether. NSAIDs can...\n\nI  do not believe:\n\nPill Treats Painful Fibroids\n\nis true because of:\n{'AI assistant': 'Fibroids are common and can cause bothersome symptoms such as pain, bleeding, and pressure in some women. However, they are also benign and deciding about how or whether to treatment them depends on how much a woman is bothered by her symptoms, feels about the pros and cons of different treatments, and whether she wishes to conserve her fertility. There are many different safe and viable treatments available, ranging from medications to minimally invasive procedures to surgery. Women who make a fully-informed decision about treatment in conjunction with their doctor are likely to be satisfied with their treatment so long as their choice matches their goals and what\u2019s important to them. Even with so many options, it would be welcome news that a drug may not just treat the symptoms but actually might reduce the size of fibroids. A new study presented at this week\u2019s European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology shows that EllaOne, currently available as an emergency contraceptive in Europe (but not in the US), may shrink fibroids and reduce symptoms relative to placebo. However, the results should be greeted cautiously. This was a small, short study and the full results have not been evaluated. More research is needed to confirm them and answer many outstanding questions. Whilet EllaOne may be shown to\u00a0 be very helpful to women with fibroids in the future, these results are\u00a0premature at best.'}\n\nAfter reading:\n\n There is no mention of the cost for the tested drug, cimaglermin, in this story. The costs for regularly prescribed drugs for the medical condition that\u2019s the focus of the study \u2014 weakened left ventricular function \u2014 are well known and although cimaglermin is an experimental drug, it should be possible to predict whether the new drug would be comparatively priced, cheaper or more expensive. Readers would benefit from that knowledge. While this story discusses that the drug seemed to benefit patients and was effective, it doesn\u2019t say how that was measured, and by how much the measurement improved due to the drug. (By digging into the research paper, via figure 3, we found that the benefits were measured by tracking absolute increases in\u00a0ejection fraction, which is the amount of blood pumped out the ventricles. It increased 8% in the group receiving a medium or high dose of the medicine.) One issue that might be confusing for readers: The story notes that a \u201cphase 1 trial like this one is designed to see if a new drug is safe, not to test its effectiveness.\u201d If that\u2019s the case, then why is the framing of the story about how effective it was? The story clearly points out that side effects included nausea and headaches, and that one participant did experience abnormal liver function after receiving the highest dose, a side effect that eventually cleared up. This is a strong point of the story: It clearly establishes that this was a small phase one randomized controlled trial, and the story explains what that means for the drug\u2019s development. A phase 1 trial like this one is designed to see if a new drug is safe, not to test its effectiveness. Before cimaglermin could be used to treat patients, it must prove its worth in a series of progressively larger and challenging trials and then be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

We spent some time on the fence...\n\nI  do not think it is completely true that:\n\nMore Than 22% of Heart-Device Implantations Aren\u2019t In Line With Guidelines\n\nis true because of:\n{'AI assistant': 'This blog post about a study revealing some new data about the overuse of heart implants does some things quite well, but it falls short on a number of our measures. See the Los Angeles Times piece which we also reviewed for comparison. While The WSJ blog includes cost information, which is too often missed in stories, it does not provide enough hard data on the risks or benefits of heart implants. It also should have done a better job evaluating the evidence in this study but, instead, left reviewers \u2013 and, we bet, readers \u2013 confused. When a study this large finds that 1 out of every 5 people may have unnecessarily undergone a surgery that led to longer hospital stays in, in a minority, a shorter life, that\u2019s big news. Reporters need to make sure that they give readers the proper context to process findings this dramatic. Identifying the best candidates for ICD pacement is not an exact science. Guidelines have been developed to help clinicians and patients determine the best course of action. The guidelines are, at best, interpretations of existing information generated in clinical trials. While useful, they are by no means exact. The study in question examined data collected from a national registry on over 100,000 patients and concluded that 1/5th of the implants were outside existing guidelines. While the findings in the study are\u00a0troubling at face value, the story appears to be a bit more complicated. The accompanying editorial places the results in a slightly different perspective. Of the four criteria examined, only one (placement of the ICD in patients with severe heart failure) is an absolute. The other three criteria are related purely to timing and not to whether the device is of value. Heart failure patients need the tools to help them ask their doctors the right questions. This story did not provide them enough of those tools.'}\n\nAfter reading:\n\n The story does not describe costs of the drug. The story states that 80 to 95% of women have no bleeding after taking the drug. However, that leaves a lot of open questions about the effectiveness of the drug. For example, how long does this benefit last? What about other symptoms of fibroids like abdominal pain and pressure? The story repeatedly mentions that the drug shrinks fibroids. By how much? Is that difference clinically meaningful? In other words, can women perceive an improvement in bulk symptoms\u00a0(pain, pressure) as a result of the decreased fibroid size? Do the fibroids grow back? The story mentions the potential harm of elevated liver function test results. However, it does not explain\u00a0 that women commonly experience abdominal pain, headaches and nausea with this drug. The story does not critically appraise the current study. This was a small study (57 patients) with a short follow-up time. The results have also yet to be fully evaluated and have only been presented at a scientific conference. The story verges on disease mongering by exaggerating the seriousness of fibroids. While it is true that up to 80% of women may have fibroids, only about 20% of women will have symptoms that are bothersome enough that they would seek treatment. Fibroids in of themselves are benign and are not problematic unless they cause symptoms and treatment should only be initiated if a woman is bothered by them. Symptoms of fibroids also most often go away after menopause. However, this story leaves the impression that all women with fibroids should be treated. The story quoted multiple independent experts. The story mentions Lupron and Uterine Artery Embolization as alternatives to EllaOne but fails to mention many other safe and effective options that are currently available. For example, oral contraceptives (which are not approved for fibroids but are commonly used for that indication) can help reduce bleeding and cramping associated with fibroids. Likewise, the Mirena IUD often stops bleeding altogether. NSAIDs can...\n\nI believe :\n\nPill Treats Painful Fibroids\n\nis\n{'Bot': 'definitely false'}\n\nI  could conclude:\n\nHeart Failure Drug Shows Promise in First Human Trial\n\nfrom:\n\nThere is no mention of the cost for the tested drug, cimaglermin, in this story. The costs for regularly prescribed drugs for the medical condition that\u2019s the focus of the study \u2014 weakened left ventricular function \u2014 are well known and although cimaglermin is an experimental drug, it should be possible to predict whether the new drug would be comparatively priced, cheaper or more expensive. Readers would benefit from that knowledge. While this story discusses that the drug seemed to benefit patients and was effective, it doesn\u2019t say how that was measured, and by how much the measurement improved due to the drug. (By digging into the research paper, via figure 3, we found that the benefits were measured by tracking absolute increases in\u00a0ejection fraction, which is the amount of blood pumped out the ventricles. It increased 8% in the group receiving a medium or high dose of the medicine.) One issue that might be confusing for readers: The story notes that a \u201cphase 1 trial like this one is designed to see if a new drug is safe, not to test its effectiveness.\u201d If that\u2019s the case, then why is the framing of the story about how effective it was? The story clearly points out that side effects included nausea and headaches, and that one participant did experience abnormal liver function after receiving the highest dose, a side effect that eventually cleared up. This is a strong point of the story: It clearly establishes that this was a small phase one randomized controlled trial, and the story explains what that means for the drug\u2019s development. A phase 1 trial like this one is designed to see if a new drug is safe, not to test its effectiveness. Before cimaglermin could be used to treat patients, it must prove its worth in a series of progressively larger and challenging trials and then be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The process can take several years. Based on these preliminary findings, larger trials are being planned, Lenihan said. But, as noted in quantify benefits criterion above, readers...\n\nbecause of:\n#Answer#\nThis HealthDay story reports on the very early results of a phase one trial of a drug, cimaglermin, intended to improve the left ventricular function among patients with a type of heart failure known as \u201csevere left ventricular systolic dysfunction.\u201d The story does clearly say that it is a phase one trial and explains that clinical use of the drug may be years away, if then. The story would have been stronger if it had detailed exactly what the researchers were measuring when they concluded the drug worked better than placebo. Obviously, if a new drug is found that works effectively to thwart this kind of heart disease, then that\u2019s good news all around, especially if the drug is needed less frequently and is well tolerated, as the story suggests. But care needs to be taken in potentially over-touting the results of these very early trials, and therefore raising the hopes of patients who may be disappointed at a later stage in the research process. Only larger studies with longer follow-up will determine whether these very preliminary results are supported or not. A key outcome to follow will be preventing admissions to the hospital for heart failure, and ultimately, prolonging life.\n\nThe claim is: \nNew Tools for Helping Heart Patients\n\nand the explanation is: \n\"This is a classic story of the potential promise of a new technology\u00a0for the health care sector. A nice anecdote sets the stage and then a number of preliminary findings are used as proxies for real evidence. It is implied that the technology will keep people healthier, happier and at less cost to our costly system. This is, unfortunately, often a fairy tale mainstay of health news journalism. It\u2019s interesting that several leading journalists wrote to us with concerns about this story. One wrote, \"\"She didn\u2019t interview a real skeptic. It is still quite possible that these devices will only yield minor results, since heart failure is, after all, an end stage disease, so it may just be rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.\"\"\". \n\nGiven the above, this claim is:\n[Bot]\nFalse\n\nTell me whether the following claim is definitely false, likely false, definitely true, or not proven after reading the passage.\n\nClaim: Seven presidents before (Barack Obama) -- Republicans and Democrats -- tried to expand health care to all Americans.\n\nPassage: \"President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law has been one of the most polarizing aspects of his presidency, with Republicans criticizing it at every turn. But the keynote speaker at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro, didn\u2019t run from it. He applauded Obama for pursuing expanded health care -- and succeeding where his predecessors had failed. \"\"Seven presidents before him -- Republicans and Democrats -- tried to expand health care to all Americans,\"\" Castro said. \"\"President Obama got it done.\"\" We wondered whether Castro\u2019s history was correct. So we checked with a variety of public policy and health care historians and found that Castro\u2019s in the ballpark -- but that a lot of caveats are in order. Let\u2019s start with the presidents who almost certainly fit Castro\u2019s definition of having \"\"tried to expand health care to all Americans.\"\" \u2022 Harry Truman. On Nov. 19, 1945, Truman wrote a message to Congress saying that \"\"the health of American children, like their education, should be recognized as a definite public responsibility.\"\" According to the Truman Library, \"\"the most controversial aspect of the plan was the proposed national health insurance plan.\"\" It called for \"\"the creation of a national health insurance fund to be run by the federal government. This fund would be open to all Americans, but would remain optional. Participants would pay monthly fees into the plan, which would cover the cost of any and all medical expenses that arose in a time of need. The government would pay for the cost of services rendered by any doctor who chose to join the program.\"\" The American Medical Association attacked the plan, characterizing the bill as \"\"socialized medicine.\"\" Truman ultimately abandoned the effort after the outbreak of the Korean War \u2022 Richard Nixon. In 1971 and 1974, Nixon offered separate proposals to expand health insurance to all, or nearly all, Americans. Generally speaking, they involved employer mandates to provide health insurance, supplemented by...\nThe response of the bot is: definitely true\n\nTell me whether the following claim is definitely false, likely false, definitely true, or not proven after reading the passage.\n\nClaim: Massage Therapy May Boost Immune System to Combat Cold, Flu\n\nPassage: Since there was no mention of costs in this news release. It would have been helpful to readers to discuss the approximate cost of a massage session, which can vary widely depending on the region, therapist and setting. The Center for Spirituality & Healing at the University of Minnesota estimates the national average for an hour-long massage to be about $60. Many people may wonder if their insurance policy would cover a massage therapy session. Insurance companies rarely pay for massage therapy, particularly for indications that aren\u2019t backed by science or evidence. The news release cited three studies, but descriptions of the research were too vague to be helpful. Readers aren\u2019t given any benefit data or any quantitative estimate on how well massage therapy actually works. We don\u2019t know how many participants were in each trial and who actually benefited from massage therapy. The release alludes to the fact several times that the immune system became stronger, but how was this measured? There are also non-specific references to the benefits of massage therapy, such as increasing the activity of white blood cells and reducing anxiety levels, but again, we don\u2019t know who actually benefited and by how much. When we looked at the studies cited we were surprised to find that none of them related to massage therapy for reducing rates of the \u201ccommon cold, flu and other seasonal illnesses,\u201d as claimed in the release. The first study was from 2010 and is described by its authors as \u201cpreliminary\u201d work that looks at a \u201csingle-session comparison of Swedish Massage Therapy with a light touch control condition\u201d measuring \u00a0\u201cOxytocin (OT), arginine-vasopressin (AVP), adrenal corticotropin hormone (ACTH), cortisol (CORT), circulating phenotypic lymphocytes markers, and mitogen-stimulated cytokine production.\u201d\u00a0 This study is far removed from patient-oriented, or even disease-oriented outcomes, and has nothing to do with their sweeping comments that massage may fend off flu and the common cold.

I found the story very simple and full of clich\u00e9s, taking the 'social' theme of the movie and turn it in to a romance comedy. The lead actor did a good job, he definitely looks like an alcoholic man, but Ana Belen is not believable as a working class woman, she looks, acts and talks very much like a 'high-standing' woman. What I mean is that Ana Belen plays herself. She does it in all her movies anyway. The whole mise-en-scene of the film was very poor. The photography is ugly, not using well at all the panoramic aspect ratio. The dialogue sounds totally scripted and dull most of the times. The comic situations are typical from Gomez Pereira, but in this case they are not funny at all and are resolved poorly. In my opinion this film is not worth watching. Only if you really love Pereira's previous films you might enjoy this one a little bit. Anyway, I walked out of the theater because I felt I was wasting my time. The film-maker was by the door.

Some people who eat out all the time use their ranges and dishwashers as storage places because the closets are already full!<br /><br />Melvin Frank and Norman Panama, a great comedy writing team from that era, saw the potential in Eric Hodgins novel, whose hero, Jim Blandings, can't stand the cramped apartment where he and his wife Muriel, and two daughters, must share.<br /><br />Jim Blandings, a Madison Ave. executive, has had it!

'' she leans forward as she tells me , but i 'm struck silent . i had no idea that lacey was back . just then the door opens with a loud click . i glance toward the front of the classroom and freeze , my breath catching in my throat . the day has just become... ____.\n\nFill in the ____:\n{'answer': '.'}\n\nFill in the blank:\n\ni am now a very old man and this is something that happened to me when i was very young -- only nine years old . it was 1914 , the summer after my brother , dan , died in the west field and not long before america got into the first world war . i 've never told anyone about what happened at the fork in the stream that day , and i never will . i 've decided to write it down , though , in this book , which i will leave on the table beside my bed . i ca n't write long , because my hands shake so these days and i have next to no strength , but i do n't think it will take long . later , someone may find what i have written . that seems likely to me , as it is pretty much human nature to look in a book marked `` diary '' after its owner has passed along . so , yes -- my works will probably be read . a better question is whether anyone will believe them . almost certainly not , but that does n't matter . it 's not belief i 'm interested in but freedom . writing can give that , i 've found . for twenty years i wrote a column called `` long ago and far away '' for the castle rock call , and i know that sometimes it works that way -- what you write down sometimes leaves you forever , like old photographs left in the bright sun , fading to nothing but white . i pray for that sort of release . a man in his eighties should be well past the terrors of childhood , but as my infirmities slowly creep up on me , like waves licking closer and closer to some indifferently built castle of sand , that terrible face grows clearer and clearer in my mind 's eye . it glows like a dark star in the constellations of my childhood . what i might have done yesterday , who i might have seen here in my room at the nursing home , what i might have said to them or they to my-those things are gone , but the face of the man in the black suit grows ever clearer , ever closer , and i remember every word he said . i do n't want to think of him but i ca n't help it , and sometimes at night my old heart beats so hard and so fast i think it will tear... ____.\nThe response is: .\n\nThis story got cut short. What comes next?\n\n`` isabeau ! get in here this instant ! '' a shiver of anticipation raced down my spine and i allowed myself time for a smile before jumping up from my desk . this was the second time mr. drake called me into his office today , and from his tone , he sounded like he was about to lose it . just as i 'd planned . i eased open the mahogany door and slipped inside , checking my hair to make sure it had n't escaped its chignon . mr. drake sat on the edge of his desk facing the doorway , perched like a bird of prey . his wavy hair was perfectly in place , but his green eyes had a wild look behind them , like i was trying his last nerve . and maybe i was . `` come here . '' his voice was dangerously low . i walked toward him slowly , suddenly feeling nervous . what if my plan backfired ? what if instead of punishing me like last time , he just fired me instead ? i swallowed , my mouth suddenly drier than a cotton ball . i stopped a couple of feet away from him , but he crooked his finger , beckoning me closer . i gulped and complied , moving forward until we were eye to eye , his gaze boring into me . he was so close now that i could smell the fresh scent of his aftershave just inches from my nose . `` what , '' he said , `` is this ? '' he thrust a piece of paper in front of me , and i suppressed a smirk . the copy i 'd made of the boardroom minutes was off center , the edge cut off in a way i knew was making him crazy . mr. drake was nothing if not a control freak . `` it 's the copy you asked for , '' i said , innocently . he grimaced before crumpling the copy into a tight ball . `` this is not the standard of work i require , isabeau , and i think you know that . where the hell is your head today ? '' he grabbed my hand , making me jump , and shoved the wad of paper into it . `` get this out of my sight and do it again . right , this time !
