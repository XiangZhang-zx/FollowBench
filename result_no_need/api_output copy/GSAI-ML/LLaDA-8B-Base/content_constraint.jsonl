Last year Ghani has said 28,000 Afghan police officers and soldiers have been killed since 2015, breaking the longstanding suppression on casualty data.Taliban insurgents claimed responsibility for the attack. Zabiullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the hardline terrorist group said they have killed 190 people in the complex attack.Last week, Taliban fighters set off a car bomb outside a highly fortified compound killing at least five people and wounding more than 110 Afghans and expatriates in the capital, Kabul.On Sunday, a suicide bombing in the southeastern province of Logar left eight policemen dead and another 10 wounded.The Taliban bombing targeted the provincial governor's convoy in Mohammad Agha district.

There were no fatalities but 33 people were injured, some severely. Two off-duty soldiers lost their legs as a result of the bombing.==Background==In February 1975 the Provisional Irish Republican Army agreed to a truce and ceasefire with the British government and the Northern Ireland Office. Seven \"incident centres\" were established in Irish nationalist areas in Northern Ireland to monitor the ceasefire and the activity of the security forces. Before the truce, the IRA active service unit (ASU) later dubbed the Balcombe Street Gang (due to the December 1975 Balcombe Street siege) had been carrying out bomb and gun attacks in Southern England since autumn 1974, mostly in and around London. Their last previous attack was an assassination attempt on former Prime Minister Edward Heath but he was not home when the attackers threw a bomb into his bedroom window on 22 December 1974.==The bombing==The Balcombe Street Gang planted a time bomb in the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham, Surrey. The IRA unit placed the 7lb bomb in a duffel bag under a seat. There was no warning and the bomb exploded at 9:20, injuring 23 civilians and 10 off-duty soldiers. The pub was used by members of the Welsh Guards who were based at the barracks nearby. Some of the injuries were very serious, with at least three soldiers losing limbs.

The cell's campaign would continue until December 1975 when they were caught at the siege of Balcombe Street.

There were no fatalities but 33 people were injured, some severely. Two off-duty soldiers lost their legs as a result of the bombing.==Background==In February 1975 the Provisional Irish Republican Army agreed to a truce and ceasefire with the British government and the Northern Ireland Office. Seven \"incident centres\" were established in Irish nationalist areas in Northern Ireland to monitor the ceasefire and the activity of the security forces. Before the truce, the IRA active service unit (ASU) later dubbed the Balcombe Street Gang (due to the December 1975 Balcombe Street siege) had been carrying out bomb and gun attacks in Southern England since autumn 1974, mostly in and around London. Their last previous attack was an assassination attempt on former Prime Minister Edward Heath but he was not home when the attackers threw a bomb into his bedroom window on 22 December 1974.==The bombing==The Balcombe Street Gang planted a time bomb in the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham, Surrey. The IRA unit placed the 7lb bomb in a duffel bag under a seat. There was no warning and the bomb exploded at 9:20, injuring 23 civilians and 10 off-duty soldiers. The pub was used by members of the Welsh Guards who were based at the barracks nearby. Some of the injuries were very serious, with at least three soldiers losing limbs. The blast blew the roof off the pub in the process. This attack marked the start of a renewed bombing campaign (Phase Two) in England and the end of the truce with the British Government. The next day, the same IRA unit exploded a bomb in Oxford Street, injuring several people.==Aftermath==One of the police officers in charge of the investigation into the bombing described it as a \"carbon copy\" of the Guildford pub bombings in October 1974 for which four people were already serving their sentences. The cell's campaign would continue until December 1975 when they were caught at the siege of Balcombe Street. The unit would eventually end up planting close to 50 bombs in London and elsewhere in southern England and carrying out several shootings which, along with the bombings, caused the deaths of nearly 20 people, injured hundreds and caused millions of pounds worth of damage to property.==See also==*Chronology of Provisional Irish Republican Army actions (1970–79)== References ==\n\nAccording to the above document, extract 4 events that satisfy the event template \"<arg1> died at <arg2> place from <arg4> medical issue, killed by <arg3> killer\".

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The building of the palace was delayed by the death of the Master of the Works, Sir William May, in 1630. The work was continued by his successor, Thomas White, who oversaw the completion of the central block of the palace in 1638. In 1639, the Master of the Works, Sir Robertcirc, reported that the palace was \"in a state of perfection\". By the end of the decade, the palace was in regular use by the monarch. In 1641, at the beginning of the English Civil War, the palace was transformed into the headquarters of the Office of Works. The monarch's last use of the palace was in 1645, when Charles I was imprisoned in the throne room for the duration of the war.

Colleen Siegel JERUSALEM 1996-08-22 Israel 's outgoing peace negotiator with Syria said on Thursday current tensions between the two countries appeared to be a storm in a teacup . Itamar Rabinovich , who as Israel 's ambassador to Washington conducted unfruitful negotiations with Syria , told Israel Radio it looked like Damascus wanted to talk rather than fight . \" It appears to me the Syrian priority is still to negotiate . The Syrians are confused , they are definitely tense , but the general assessment here in Washington is that this is essentially a storm in a teacup , \" he said . Rabinovich is winding up his term as ambassador . He will be replaced by Eliahu Ben-Elissar , a former Israeli envoy to Egypt and right-wing Likud party politician . Israel on Wednesday sent Syria a message , via Washington , saying it was committed to peace and wanted to open negotiations without preconditions . But it slammed Damascus for creating what it called a dangerous atmosphere . Syria accused Israel on Wednesday of launching a hysterical campaign against it after Israeli television reported that Damascus had recently test fired a missile . It said its arms purchases were for defensive purposes . \" The message that we sent to ( Syrian President Hafez al- ) Assad is that Israel is ready at any time without preconditions to enter peace negotiations , \" Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy told Israel Radio in an interview . Tension has mounted since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took office in June vowing to retain the Golan Heights Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war . Israeli-Syrian peace talks have been deadlocked over the Golan since 1991 despite the previous government 's willingness to make Golan concessions . Peace talks between the two sides were last held in February . \" The voices coming out of Damascus are bad , not good . The media ... are full of expressions and declarations that must be worrying ... this artificial atmosphere is very dangerous because those who spread it could become its prisoners , \" Levy said . \" We expect from Syria , if its face is to peace , that it will answer Israel 's message to enter peace negotiations because that is our goal , \" he said . \" We do not want a war , God forbid . No one benefits from wars . \" Israel 's Channel Two television said Damascus had sent a \" calming signal \" to Israel . It gave no source for the report . Netanyahu and Levy 's spokesmen said they could not confirm it . The television also said that Netanyahu had sent messages to reassure Syria via Cairo , the United States and Moscow .\n\nAccording to the above document, extract one named entity that 1) is a person; 2) contains more than one word; 3) is an Israeli politician; 4) was born after 1940; 5) is the chairman of the Likud party.
