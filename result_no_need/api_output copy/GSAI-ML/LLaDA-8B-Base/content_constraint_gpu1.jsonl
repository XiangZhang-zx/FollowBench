Question: Question: What is the name of the person that was sentenced to death? If there is no answer, please output \"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\". Movie title: The Sentinel Context: The film opens with a flashback to 1968, where a young John Smith (Christian Bale) is working as a security guard at a Los Angeles police station. He is approached by a man who claims to be a police officer. Smith shoots the man, who is then revealed to be a bank robber. Smith is then arrested and sentenced to death. The film then jumps forward to 1995, where Smith is now a successful businessman. He is approached by a man named Frank Moses (Michael Imperioli), who claims to be a former police officer who was present at Smith's trial. Frank tells Smith that he has evidence that Smith is innocent and that he will help him prove his innocence. Smith is initially skeptical, but eventually agrees to meet with Frank. During their meeting, Frank shows Smith a series of photographs that appear to show Smith as the bank robber. Smith is shocked and confused, but Frank insists that he has more proof. Frank then reveals that he has been following Smith for years and that he has been trying to convince him to come forward with his innocence. Smith is initially hesitant, but eventually agrees to meet with Frank again. During their second meeting, Frank shows Smith a series of photographs that appear to show Smith as the bank robber.
