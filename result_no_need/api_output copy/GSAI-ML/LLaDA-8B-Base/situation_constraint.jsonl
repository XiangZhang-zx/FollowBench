On your desk, there's a golden key. You take the key and place it inside a blue envelope. You then place this envelope inside a red book titled \"Mysteries of the Universe\". Closing the book, you carry it to the library room. In the library, you place the red book on a wooden shelf next to a green plant. You then decide to grab a black notebook from the adjacent shelf. As you pick it up, you slip the blue envelope from the red book into the black notebook. Carrying both books, you proceed to the dining room. On the dining table, you set down the black notebook but decide to place the red book inside a drawer of a nearby cabinet. After a few minutes, you pick up the black notebook and walk to the study.\n\nGiven the actions taken, where is the golden key at the end of this scenario?"}
