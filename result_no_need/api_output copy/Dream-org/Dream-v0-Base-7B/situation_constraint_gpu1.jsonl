The parameter `l` is the input list of the function and `n` is the integer that represents the number of times an element needs to appear in the input list. The function uses the `unique` function to return a list with elements that appear exactly n times in the given list and sort the list in ascending order.  To define the `unique` function, we create two variables, `result` and `count`, which will store the result list and a dictionary to count the occurrences of each element in the input list.  In the `for` loop, we iterate through the elements of the list and create a new dictionary to count the elements of the list. The `for` loop iterates through the elements of the list and increments the count of the element in the `count` dictionary. If the count of the element in `count` is equal to 1 and the element is not in the `result` dictionary, we append the element and its count to the `result` list.  Finally, we use the `sorted` function in Python to sort the `result` list in ascending order. The function will return the list of elements that appear exactly n times in the given list.  To test the function, we can create a new list with the elements of the list and call the function `test_unique` with the `unique` function and the `sorted` function.  >>> test_unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123], 1) [0, 2, 9, 123] >>> test_unique([1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4], 1) [1, 3] >>> test_unique([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 1) ["}}], "generation": "def unique(l: list, n: int): \"\"\"Return a list with elements that appear exactly n times in the given list, sorted in ascending order Example: unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123], 1) Output: [0, 2, 9, 123]  \"\"\" Explanation:  To start the function, we define the function `unique` which takes two parameters, `l` and `n`.

If the count of the element in `count` is equal to 1 and the element is not in the `result` dictionary, we append the element and its count to the `result` list.  Finally, we use the `sorted` function in Python to sort the `result` list in ascending order. The function will return the list of elements that appear exactly n times in the given list.  To test the function, we can create a new list with the elements of the list and call the function `test_unique` with the `unique` function and the `sorted` function.  >>> test_unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123], 1) [0, 2, 9, 123] >>> test_unique([1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4], 1) [1, 3] >>> test_unique([1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 1) ["}
