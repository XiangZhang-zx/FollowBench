And ministers still won't tell us if relief is on the way,\" TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said.\nInflation measured by the most commonly used method, CPI, which does not take housing costs into account, has picked up in recent months hitting 2.9% in May. According to the Bank of England it averaged 2.7% a year between 2010 and 2016.\nThe TUC calculates that if firefighters' wages had kept pace with inflation their average pay would be nearly \u00a32,900 higher than it is. For nuclear engineers and teachers the figure is about \u00a32,500.\nOn the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, Chancellor Philip Hammond said public sector pay had \"raced ahead\" of the private sector after the economic crash in 2008.\nHe added that when \"very generous\" public sector pension contributions were taken into account, public sector workers enjoyed a 10% \"premium\" over their private sector counterparts,\nBut Mr Hammond refused to comment on reports he had said at a meeting that public servants were \"overpaid\".\nThe average pay for an NHS paramedic is \u00a335,577.\nBut if the paramedic's salary in 2010 had kept pace with inflation measured by CPI, by now he or she should be earning \u00a339,435 - \u00a33,888 more, says the TUC.\nThe TUC says if RPI (the inflation measure which does include housing costs) is used, the paramedic would need to earn \u00a341,717 - \u00a36,140 more -  to maintain their 2010 spending power.\nThe TUC's analysis suggests workers in different parts of the public sector are out of pocket in real terms to varying degrees (based on...\n\nSo I recapped it in layman's terms:\n[Response]\nFirefighters, teachers and other public sector workers are thousands of pounds a year worse off than they were in 2010, the TUC has said.\n\nMy college roommate asked me what this article means:\n\nSingers Che Chesterman, Louisa Johnson, Lauren Murray and rap duo Reggie N Bollie will all be hoping to make it through to the Christmas finals at Wembley Arena next week.\nFamous singer Lionel Richie will be the guest mentor this week, and popstars Sia and Jason Derulo will also be performing.\nBut, whoever wins will be joining a long line of X Factor singers, here is how the previous winners have got on since winning the show...\nLast year's winner Ben Haenow beat Fleur East, and grabbed a Christmas number one with his X Factor debut single, 'Something I Need'.\nHe's now signed to Simon Cowell's record label Syco, and has recently released his debut album, which even has a duet with famous singer Kelly Clarkson on it.\nSam Bailey managed to score the first X Factor Christmas number one in three years with her single 'Skyscraper' in 2013, as well as giving birth to her daughter.\nShe has also supported her idol, pop superstar Beyonce, on one of her UK tour dates for her 'Mrs Carter World Tour' in 2014, and performed in a West End show.\nJames' debut single 'Impossible' became the fastest selling X Factor single of any X Factor winner, and sold over one million copies.\nThe singer has left Simon Cowell's record label and is currently working on his second album.\nHe's performed at V Festival and successfully toured the UK this year.\nLittle Mix were a group of singers who came together on the show to become the first band to win the competition.\nSince winning the show they have sold more than five million singles and scooped a fair few awards.\nThey were the first girl band since The Pussycat Dolls to reach the top five in America with their album. Their new single 'Black Magic' has placed at number 68 in the Billboard Hot 100 Charts in America - That's their highest chart position in the US.\nMatt Cardle beat pop mega-group One Direction to take the series seven crown back in 2010.\nMatt is currently recording his fourth album which is expected to be released later this year and also starred in a hit musical called...\n\nSo I recapped it in layman's terms:\n[Response]\nIt's the semi-finals on the X Factor this week, so we're taking a look back at the past winners, to see what happened after they won.\n\nMy college roommate asked me what this article means:\n\nMichael Burden, 76, needed to be moved from Leicester's Royal Infirmary (LRI) to a rehabilitation unit in Market Harborough.\nHis daughter Emma Purcell said the time he had to wait was unacceptable.\nArriva, which supplies the non-urgent ambulance transfers, apologised to the family for the \"unacceptable\" delay.\nMr Burden, who is now recovering at St Luke's Hospital, was in a waiting area at the LRI on Wednesday.\nMrs Purcell said:  \"I went in and saw him sitting in a chair. Just a chair with his little bag packed next to his feet where he'd been since 9.30 that morning.\n\"All the staff on the ward are as frustrated as you are, because they can't do anything.\"\nAsiya Jelani, Arriva spokesperson, said: \"Delays of this nature are unacceptable and we do understand the impact they have on both patients and their families.\n\"We have made many improvements to the service we provide in Leicestershire over the last year and we continue to work closely with our NHS colleagues to identify ways in which we can further improve the service we provide.\"\nA spokesperson for the Clinical Commissioning Group for East Leicestershire and Rutland, which commissions healthcare services for the NHS, said Arriva's performance was being monitored closely but it had been \"adversely affected by the unprecedented demand and pressures on the healthcare system this winter\".\n\nSo I recapped it in layman's terms:\n[Response]\nA woman was left furious after her father waited almost nine hours for a hospital transfer while recovering from a stroke.\n\nMy college roommate asked me what this article means:\n\nScotland international Tonks, 26, joined the Exiles last month from Edinburgh in a bid to help them climb away from the bottom of the table.\nAnd he kicked 13 points in the crucial 23-18 victory against Gloucester on Sunday to boost their survival hopes.\n\"I'm enjoying being part of the club and set up, but obviously I've arrived at a tough time,\" he told BBC Sport.\nTonks, whose last international appearance came against Italy in August, has signed a deal with Irish until the end of the season.\nThe former Leicester and Northampton player hopes a regular run of appearances in the number 10 shirt will not only guide London Irish to safety, but put him in the frame for a Scotland recall.\n\"I'm enjoying getting a run of games and having a real shot at fly-half,\" he said.\n\"The Scotland coaches have told me if I'm playing well regularly, it doesn't matter if it's in Scotland, England or anywhere.\n\"I enjoy having a strong input in how we play the game. Hopefully, I can pass that on to my team-mates and implement the way the coaches want us to play the game.\"\n\nSo I recapped it in layman's terms:",
