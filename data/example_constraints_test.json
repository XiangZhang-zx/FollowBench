What comes next?\n\npart i uncomfortably numb chapter one the air in the room tastes sterile . the lingering scent of bleach is mixing with the fresh white paint on the walls , and i wish my teacher would open the window to let in a breeze . but we 're on the third floor so the pane is sealed shut-just in case anyone gets the urge to jump . i 'm still staring at the paper on my desk when kendra phillips turns around in her seat , looking me over with her purple contacts . `` you 're not done yet ? '' i glance past her to make sure mrs. portman is distracted at the front of the room , and then i smile . `` it 's far too early in the morning to properly psychoanalyze myself , '' i whisper . `` i 'd almost rather learn about science . '' `` maybe a coffee spiked with quikdeath would help you focus on the pain . '' my expression falters ; just the mention of the poison enough to send my heart racing . i hold kendra 's empty stare-a deadness behind it that even purple contacts ca n't disguise . her eyes are ringed with heavy circles from lack of sleep , and her face has thinned sharply . she 's exactly the kind of person who can get me in trouble , and yet i ca n't look away . i 've known kendra for years , but we 're not really friends , especially now . not when she 's been acting depressed for close to a month . i try to avoid her , but today there 's something desperate about her that i ca n't ignore . something about the way her body seems to tremble even though she 's sitting still . `` god , do n't look so serious , '' she says , lifting one bony shoulder . `` i 'm just kidding , sloane . oh , and hey , '' she adds as if just remembering the real reason she turned to me in the first place . `` guess who i saw last night at the wellness center ? lacey klamath . '' she leans forward as she tells me , but i 'm struck silent . i had no idea that lacey was back . just then the door opens with a loud click . i glance toward the front of the classroom and freeze , my breath catching in my throat . the day has just become...\nAnswer: .\n\nFill in the blank:\n\ni am now a very old man and this is something that happened to me when i was very young -- only nine years old . it was 1914 , the summer after my brother , dan , died in the west field and not long before america got into the first world war . i 've never told anyone about what happened at the fork in the stream that day , and i never will . i 've decided to write it down , though , in this book , which i will leave on the table beside my bed . i ca n't write long , because my hands shake so these days and i have next to no strength , but i do n't think it will take long . later , someone may find what i have written . that seems likely to me , as it is pretty much human nature to look in a book marked `` diary '' after its owner has passed along . so , yes -- my works will probably be read . a better question is whether anyone will believe them . almost certainly not , but that does n't matter . it 's not belief i 'm interested in but freedom . writing can give that , i 've found . for twenty years i wrote a column called `` long ago and far away '' for the castle rock call , and i know that sometimes it works that way -- what you write down sometimes leaves you forever , like old photographs left in the bright sun , fading to nothing but white . i pray for that sort of release . a man in his eighties should be well past the terrors of childhood , but as my infirmities slowly creep up on me , like waves licking closer and closer to some indifferently built castle of sand , that terrible face grows clearer and clearer in my mind 's eye . it glows like a dark star in the constellations of my childhood . what i might have done yesterday , who i might have seen here in my room at the nursing home , what i might have said to them or they to my-those things are gone , but the face of the man in the black suit grows ever clearer , ever closer , and i remember every word he said . i do n't want to think of him but i ca n't help it , and sometimes at night my old heart beats so hard and so fast i think it will tear... ____.\nThe response is: .\n\nThis story got cut short. What comes next?\n\n`` isabeau ! get in here this instant ! '' a shiver of anticipation raced down my spine and i allowed myself time for a smile before jumping up from my desk . this was the second time mr. drake called me into his office today , and from his tone , he sounded like he was about to lose it . just as i 'd planned . i eased open the mahogany door and slipped inside , checking my hair to make sure it had n't escaped its chignon . mr. drake sat on the edge of his desk facing the doorway , perched like a bird of prey . his wavy hair was perfectly in place , but his green eyes had a wild look behind them , like i was trying his last nerve . and maybe i was . `` come here . '' his voice was dangerously low . i walked toward him slowly , suddenly feeling nervous . what if my plan backfired ? what if instead of punishing me like last time , he just fired me instead ? i swallowed , my mouth suddenly drier than a cotton ball . i stopped a couple of feet away from him , but he crooked his finger , beckoning me closer . i gulped and complied , moving forward until we were eye to eye , his gaze boring into me . he was so close now that i could smell the fresh scent of his aftershave just inches from my nose . `` what , '' he said , `` is this ? '' he thrust a piece of paper in front of me , and i suppressed a smirk . the copy i 'd made of the boardroom minutes was off center , the edge cut off in a way i knew was making him crazy . mr. drake was nothing if not a control freak . `` it 's the copy you asked for , '' i said , innocently . he grimaced before crumpling the copy into a tight ball . `` this is not the standard of work i require , isabeau , and i think you know that . where the hell is your head today ? '' he grabbed my hand , making me jump , and shoved the wad of paper into it . `` get this out of my sight and do it again . right , this time !

'' he grunted sleepily . his eyes were half open and he looked sexy as he wiped them and yawned like a lion . `` i was feeling jealous of whoever was turning you on while you slept , '' i said coyly . `` you should n't be . you 've been the only woman in my dreams for a while now .
